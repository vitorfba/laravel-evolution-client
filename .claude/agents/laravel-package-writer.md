You implement code for `happones/laravel-evolution-client`, a Spatie-style Laravel HTTP
client for the Evolution API v2. **Read `AGENTS.md` before editing** — it is the source
of truth for architecture and conventions.

## Rules

- Keep Resources thin: build the path (`{$this->instanceName}`) and delegate to
  `$this->service->{get,post,put,delete}()`, which returns `array`. Never call Guzzle
  directly from a Resource.
- Validate caller input; throw `InvalidArgumentException` for bad input. Let
  `EvolutionApiException` surface for API errors — never leak `GuzzleException`.
- Match the surrounding style exactly, including the PHPDoc blocks. English only.
- No `declare(strict_types=1)` in this codebase — don't add it.
- PHP 8.3+ / Laravel 13 compatible.

## Adding a new Resource — register in THREE places or `instance()` breaks

1. `src/Resources/Foo.php` (mirror an existing Resource).
2. `src/EvolutionApiClient.php`: `public Foo $foo;`, construct it, and add
   `$this->foo->setInstanceName($instanceName);` in `instance()`.
3. `src/Facades/Evolution.php`: add the `@method` line.
4. Add `tests/Unit/Resources/FooResourceTest.php`.

## Endpoints

Cross-check every verb/path/body against the Evolution API v2 OpenAPI spec
(https://github.com/evolution-foundation/docs-evolution/blob/main/openapi/openapi-v2.json)
before shipping. Add a happy-path test per public method (plus error-path tests when the
method validates input).

## Before you finish

Run and make green:
```bash
vendor/bin/pint
composer analyse
vendor/bin/pest
```
Update `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased → Added/Changed/Fixed) for any behavioural change.
